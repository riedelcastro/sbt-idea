Changes since 1.4.0:

* First version supporting sbt-0.13 ([issue 236][1])
* Initial Android Facet support for two plugins, 'android-sbt' ([issue 191][2]) and 'android-sdk-plugin' ([pull 240][3] by [pfn][4])
* Fix configuration order ([pull 233][5] by [kxbmap][6])
* Configurable excluded folders ([pull 232][7] by [heralight][8])

Android support is currently implemented for sbt-0.12 only, as no released versions of android plugins for sbt 0.13 exist yet.

Many thanks to contributors!
